# üìö Book API - Task 3 (Web Development Internship)

This project is part of **Task 3** from the Web Development Internship program.  
The objective was to **create a REST API using Node.js and Express.js** to manage a list of books with basic CRUD operations.  
The books are stored **in memory (no database used)**.

---

## üéØ Objective
- Build a simple REST API for **CRUD operations** on books.
- Learn the basics of:
  - REST API
  - Express.js
  - HTTP Methods
  - JSON handling
  - Middleware in Express
  - CRUD operations

---

## üöÄ Features / Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint     | Description              |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|
| GET    | `/books`    | Get all books            |
| POST   | `/books`    | Add a new book           |
| PUT    | `/books/:id`| Update a book by ID      |
| DELETE | `/books/:id`| Delete a book by ID      |

---

## üõ† Tools & Technologies
- **Node.js** (runtime)
- **Express.js** (framework)
- **Postman** (API testing)

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git clone https://github.com/tsujit74/elevatlab
   cd book-api-task3
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The API will run on: **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**
